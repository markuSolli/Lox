# Lox
I'm currently reading the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom, where the author guides us through writing an interpreter for the language Lox.
The code in this repository is not my own, but copy-pasted from the code snippets in the book.  

## Java implementation
Source code is found in the `src` directory.  
Progress: [#---------]
